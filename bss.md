# Oxyopia BSS FAQ
Hello! You are probably wondering why this page exists. Well, I recieve quite a few questions regarding BSS daily, usually one of the following:
- Do you have an updated hive guide?
- Should I be using (bee) in a (color) hive?
- Why doesn't your guide have (bee)?
- Why should I use (bee) in (color) hive?
- How do you design your hive guides? (this is answered below)

## General answer (READ THIS)
To answer almost all of these questions, I don't know. I quit the game following burnout and just the game being a bit boring tbh.
My hive guides were made in the start of 2022, during the period where metas were frequently changing during the start of Beesmas that year, along with the addition of the Buoyant/Precise bees.

## "Do you have an updated hive guide?
no, see above.

## "How do you design your hive guides?"
I made my guides using Photoshop (there are more accessible equivalents), the bee slots are simply hexagons placed in a similar layout to the BSS hive, and the bee faces are simply decals extracted from Onett's player inventory or the BSS wiki.
The font used is Futura (it's quite ugly looking back at it now).

and probably more that I do not know of!

I am no longer playing Bee Swarm, so please do not ask me for advice, purely as I will probably give a wrong answer.
